# Reinforcement Learning notebooks

These notebooks are created to implement different algorithms to solve different RL problems.

* The first series of notebooks shown are some notebooks to solve a deterministic Grid world problem, where the agent-environment system can be discretized.
* The second series of notebooks shown are to solve an also deterministic Cart-pole problem, where the agent-environment system cannot be discretized and hence is continuous. Hence, we use deep learning based methods to solve this problem.
